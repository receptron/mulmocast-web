      {
        question: "Does it cost money?",
        answer:
          "The application itself is free to use. However, you will need API Keys from providers such as OpenAI / Google / Anthropic. There are costs associated with using those APIs.",

        answer:
          "To use the gpt-image-1 model, you need to complete organization verification (Verify Organization) on your OpenAI account. This is a separate procedure from paid plans like ChatGPT Plus.",

        question: "The generated video doesn't match my expectations. What should I do?",
        answer:
          "MulmoCast generates movies by combining generated images with movie generation prompts. If no images are generated, the movie is created using only the movie generation prompt.\n\nTo generate movies closer to your intended result, please try one of the following methods:",

      {
        question: "The latter half of the movie becomes a still image. What should I do?",
        answer:
          "When the audio length (text volume) exceeds the movie generation time, the latter half is displayed as a still image.\n\nDepending on the movie generation model you use, there is a time limit for each movie generation. For example, when using Google (Veo3), movies are generated with a fixed duration of 8 seconds.\n\nIn this case, please adjust using one of the following methods:",
        methods: [
          "Accept that the latter half becomes a still image",

        question: "The movie generated from the movie prompt gets cut off midway. What should I do?",
        answer:
          "When generating a movie using a movie generation prompt, MulmoCast trims the video based on the audio length when combining audio and video. Therefore, if the generated video is longer than the audio, the video may be cut off at the end of the audio.\n\nIn this case, add audioParams.padding in Advanced Mode to create padding at the end of the audio.\n\nPlease follow these steps:",
